Installing & Testing phpMyIDE
=============================
* Unpack the zip or tar.gz into the directory of your choice.

* Set your web server to point to the same directory.

* Using any text editor, modify the config.php file to reflect 
  your primary database connection. Detailed information about the
  settings of these parameters are in that file.
  
* run the buildsql.php routine ... this will create the necessary tables
  for phpMyIDE in your zeroth connection record. If you do not do this, 
  you will start to see troubles when using the command prompt and printing
  things.
  
* Using your browser, call the testinstall.php page. This small routine
  will test the requirements for phpMyIDE and return a quick outline of
  what is available and what is not. Note that if you can't get to that
  page, then nothing will work at all ;)
  
* That's it! You should be all good to go. If you have more troubles, 
  please contact the development team at http://www.perkiset.org/forum/
  and address your questions in the phpMyIDE boards.

Permissions
===========
Once the package is unpacked, you may consider changing the permissions
  to help you with security. The steps for this would be (from the IDE root dir):
  chmod -R 664 *
  chmod 666 current-connection
  chmod 775 graphics
  chmod 775 source
  chmod 775 resources
